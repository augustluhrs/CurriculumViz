","This course was previously titled Advanced Acting: Realism and Beyond, and cannot be repeated.
This next level acting course turns traditional, realistic scene study on its head. We begin with the essentials: digging into the skills for building precise, emotionally connected, intelligently crafted, character-specific, and theatrically articulate performance inside a realistic context. We then use those skills as a springboard to invent new ways of building a compelling narrative through forms of multi-media and devised storytelling. In this course students explore and expand their understanding of “what is character?” And, who’s telling the story and why and how are they telling it? This course is a laboratory for constructing, deconstructing and reconstructing narrative – a place to turn the story on its head to see what new story we can make. Students will engage in studio exercises to build clear skills in acting technique and stage composition and practice with various forms of crafting theatrical stories. In addition, students are expected to analyze, rehearse, and perform one short, realistic two-person scene, create a solo devised piece, and participate in ensemble-devised, multi-media performance pieces for a final showing at the conclusion of the semester. Students are also required to complete a detailed character/script analysis to support their exploration of the journey from realistic theatre
to expanded forms of theatrical/performative storytelling.  This is a next level performance class; students must have successfully completed Acting I, Performance Practice or have equivalent experience in performance coursework to register for the class.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=16Z5f2et8_c_n7C3tApMNGq0ME8CYRZsq,Photo by Mary Bitel,,,,

The act of being filmed every class gives actors and performers more confidence and prepares them for working in professional settings. Class projects allow for interdisciplinary work incorporating writing, directing, music, animation, and visual arts. Actors work to develop and expand their individual set of acting techniques and technical skills that work best on screen to create specificity in ""moment-to-moment being,"" all of which expands the understanding of the actor’s role in visual storytelling. Students perform analyzed scripted scenes, “cold” reads, and improvize unscripted on-camera exercises. Equal time and energy in this workshop is dedicated to creating new work with two projects: Bio-Pic project, and  Fusion Short. The Bio-Pic project is a deep dive into character with each actor choosing a real person they identify with to research, curate, improv, write and portray in short scenes with acting and design support from other students. Fusion Short is a devised short film project.  Production teams will develop and film group generated scripts. For each Fusion Short, everyone acts (cameo, supporting or lead) and takes the lead on the creative production team as head writer, director, production design, director of photography.

The final showing is a multi-channel immersive installation. ,"In the 1940s, Maya Deren, a trailblazer in choreography, dance, and experimental filmmaking, pioneered the groundbreaking concept of choreocinema"": a genre merging dynamic camera movement with dance. In 1970, media artist Gene Youngblood, penned the influential work ""Expanded Cinema""--exemplified by Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a revolutionary multimedia performance project melding live rock music and avant-garde film Projections. Today, contemporary artists like Jacolby Satterwhite carry forward this legacy, amalgamating choreocinema and expanded cinema through mediums such as performance, motion capture, and digital animation, to forge immersive installations. Their work resonates with our present era, marked by the ubiquitous presence of screens that have profoundly redefined our perception of reality, corporeal existence, and digital identities. ""Choreocinema and the Expanding Eye"" offers an immersive exploration of dance film, media installation and live performance using the interplay of time, space, movement and the human body.

The final performance event is open to the public.","The dreamer is at once the author, the actor, and the audience for a performance that takes place while the dreamer is unconscious. Whether regarded as omens, as products of our unconscious wishes, or as our brain’s way of cleaning up memory space, dreams are an undeniable component of the human experience, and, in addition to generating many theories, they have also served as inspiration for artists searching for a direct route to the unconscious. This class is an investigation of dreams as a springboard for art. At once theoretical and practical, the class will begin by examining the main theories regarding dreams, ranging from Freud and Jung, who pioneered psychological interpretations of dreams, to the more scientific research of the later 20th century, wherein dreams are seen more neurologically, as a way for the brain to process and sort information. After laying in the theoretical foundation, the class will focus mainly on a succession of dream performances inspired by the dreams of class participants. While dreams are experienced by the individual dreamer, these projects will all be collaborative, and involve working in groups of 3 or 4. Each will be staged in three-dimensional space in real time, and endeavor to create the dream experience for the audience. All should be multidisciplinary in nature, containing elements of theater, sound, visual art, video, and other emerging technologies. Throughout the term, we will screen movies (which in themselves have provoked theories that liken the experience of watching a film to that of dreaming) and look at images from art-history inspired by dreams. We will also investigate games that use dream content as their governing narrative engine. This will enable us to appreciate the wide range of strategies that artists have used when making art based on dreams – from using dreams to explore the non-linear logic of the individual’s unconscious (as in the surrealists), to the more communal dream experience of modern trauma (as in El Abrazo de la Serpiente).

The course goes over the basics of electronic circuits and coding for Arduino — programmable micro-computers that process inputs from buttons, biofeedback sensors, and microphones and translate them into outputs expressed through LED lights, sounds, motors, and relays. We use laser cutters, 3D printers, woodworking tools, and sewing machines to assist us, and learn the best practices of creating robust circuits through soldering, component selection, and power supply. Each week we look to contemporary hardware artists for inspiration and use our classmates to test and analyze our prototypes, getting feedback on not just the practical design of the circuits and mechanisms, but the feelings, ideas, and creative effects our connected art elicits. No prior coding, hardware, or fabrication experience necessary, but time and dedication is — most projects will require out-of-class time spent in the shop. Students will need a laptop, but basic hardware and materials will be provided.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aRJcEe_wslhOboDwnFCHHFvXSbZ8p-NQ,Ray Chen,,,,
Experimental RISO,Kelli Anderson,VISUAL ART,4,Fall,,,"The death of printed matter has been predicted for more than half a century. Meanwhile, artists have been busy continually proving that print media—and the nimble RISO, in particular—offers vital new possibilities for experimentation. With a capacity to layer pure spot color, like silkscreen, and output quickly, like digital processes, the Risograph duplicator has revolutionized visual culture over the past decade. RISO aesthetics have made their way into animation and film, into mainstream digital design culture, and has flooded independent art book publishing. Because the process engages and serves niche communities of artists, it has given voice to groups traditionally excluded from mainstream publishing. It is the machine largely responsible for the thriving, international small press movement, which challenges both the traditional scarcity-based economy of the art market, and the myth of the lone artist. Experimental RISO will take this spirit as a starting point, as our class works together as a small community to push the RISO into more experimental territory. We will explore a myriad of “off label” uses for RISO printmaking. We will design non-digital publications using exquisite corpse methods and learn how to translate film and animation into RISO. Avant-garde publishing has a long history of cutting through the so-called dichotomy between paper and electronics, so we will use conditional design “codes” to design programmatically. We will investigate the RISO’s potential to produce performance-based art—looking to Bruno Munari and Victorian Troublewit performance for possible inroads.",,,,,,

Final Cohort Experience,,SOUL,UNKNOWN,Spring,,Where the seniors shape the future of Collaborative Arts.,"(OLD) CA Capstone is an opportunity for graduating students to produce original interdisciplinary works of art that allow them to reflect and expand on their practice, skills, knowledge and insights they have gathered during their time at Collaborative Arts. While the works can take any form, we encourage collaborative projects and expect a collaborative process. Students as a group will be responsible for curating a final group show that brings all their work together into a cohesive narrative and engaging community experience. Throughout the semester students will compose and give feedback to each other’s individual artist statements and project “maps”, produce a curatorial statement, press-release, and invitation for the show. Works in the show should reflect the artist's playfulness, experimentation, curiosity, openness, originality and mastery of the tools employed. Agility in reason, intellectual rigor, attention to detail, contextualization, references and documentation - as well as final presentation - will all be important aspects of how the work will be assessed and evaluated. The class will be a combination of in-class workshops, review of weekly assignments, critique of work in progress, guest lectures, 1-on-1 sessions, and art outings. ",,,,,,

Students write, direct, and produce one short, 5-7 minute, film. The course builds upon the visual storytelling tools learned in the prerequisite courses, Fundamentals of Filmmaking I, or Cinematic Narratives. Students will strengthen their skills in screenwriting, cinematography, aesthetics, and editing to further develop their personal filmmaking style. Students can choose to create a traditional narrative film with dialog, or they can choose alternative types of performance and filmmaking that create narrative style flow in different ways. Students must have a rough draft script, or one page treatment, ready by the first day of classes as writing and rewriting work begins in week one. Each student writes and directs their own film, and then they serve as crew members for their classmates when they direct their films.
Students can also choose to break the constraints of the traditional solo director/auteur theory, and choose to co-direct and Co-Create their film with a partner. Students with more experience in acting or performing can partner with other students who have more experience with writing, directing, or cinematography - and they can explore the opportunities within the emerging trend of Co-Creative filmmaking.
Students are guided by their Professor, and a Production Advisor, through all the production logistics that are necessary for successful filmmaking - including casting, art direction, props, locations, schedules, call times, insurance, equipment, wardrobe, effects, editing and more.

All art production has an environmental impact. To develop sustainable studio practices, artists must familiarize themselves with the consequences of material choices and processes, such as their carbon footprint, supply chain, environmental justice issues, land use, water footprint, toxicity, and end-of-life management. Workshops in the classroom include experiments with mycelium, bioplastics, vegan adhesives, and nontoxic paints as alternatives to commercially available products. To understand the links between the fast demands of disposable culture and its effect on biodiversity, exhaustion of natural resources, and climate change, we will visit a recycling facility, an oyster reef, and a rooftop farm to learn about environmental projects and initiatives on a city scale. For class projects, students will invest their creativity to do more with less impact by reusing, repurposing, and recycling the city's abundance and waste.

Instances of such non-dualistic thought in art, science, philosophy, and craft are looked at as a way to question established knowledge systems and propose new futures. Non-dualistic thought is approached here as a way to escape established binaries and create a space that goes beyond good/bad, right/wrong and instead invites multiplicity and a wide range of perspectives and voices. Starting with Mallarmé’s seminal poem, “A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance,” and concluding with Muñoz’s essay “Feeling Utopia” from his book Cruising Utopia, where he opens with Oscar Wilde’s quote: “a map of the world that does not include utopia is not worth glancing at,” the course challenges students to “feel hope and to feel utopia” as a form of resistance to established dystopian narratives.
